- get better font, e.g. pixely to match the aesthetic.
- give clouds black outline?
- make it save progress on disk instead of memory
- fix issue where if you keep hitting space quickly right after dying, glitches the game. either has both scenes running at once, or crashes
- make bird-pipe collision not make sound if it was only a light hit (or adjust volume based on how hard the hit was)
- add sound effect for starting the game
- fix clouds despawning randomly
