- add music
- add sound effects
- get better font, e.g. pixely to match the aesthetic.
- give clouds black outline?
- make it save progress on disk instead of memory
- fix issue where if you keep hitting space quickly right after dying, glitches the game. either has both scenes running at once, or crashes
